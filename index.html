    <b>The smartphone takeover</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    The first interesting fact I read was that while many people think they are
    addicted to their phones – and I include myself in that group – the truth is
    they have just switched activities and now spend the time they used to waste
    on other activities using their smartphones. And many app creators are
    employing various tricks to make that happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    How many times a day do you check your phone? Where does the need to see
    what's new come from? Why is it that you cannot control yourself? These are
    the questions I set out to answer, and after some hours of research, I could
    find some facts I'll now share.
  </p>
  <p>
    From loads of notifications to psychological tools, app designers certainly
    know how to grab our attention. Everything we see is there for a reason, and
    the main goal is generally to keep us entertained. When we wait for content
    to load or download, this can sometimes take some time. The design of the
    progress indicators can help remove the frustration of having to wait. For
    example, a circular or revolving design can be very visually appealing. It
    is these little tricks that keep us coming back for more. Maybe simpler but
    also effective is changing colours. Many apps change their icons
    periodically. Not because they decided other colours are prettier, but
    because we will notice the difference and therefore feel curious and be
    willing to see what's new. More often than not, it's only the icon that
    changes, but by the time we discover that we're back there, using our phones
    again.

    Will I stop checking my phone every five minutes now that I know about these
    tricks? I don't think so. But at least I know why I want to look at my phone
    all the time.
